# Try Hack Me - [Vulnerability Capstone](https://tryhackme.com/jr/vulnerabilitycapstone)
##### Apply the knowledge gained throughout the Vulnerability Module in this challenge room.

## Task 1 - Introduction 

Summarise the skills learnt in this module by completing this capstone room for the "Vulnerability Research" module.
Ackme Support Incorporated has recently set up a new blog. Their developer team have asked for a security audit to be performed before they create and publish articles to the public.
It is your task to perform a security audit on the blog; looking for and abusing any vulnerabilities that you find.
