# [Information Gathering](../Techniques/InformationGathering/README.md)
  Information gathering focuses on the business and the infrastructure.  It involves both passive (OSINT) and active methods.  Active methods invovle interacting directly with the target.  Therefore, the target may detect active methods, revealing the attack.  Conversely, passive methods rely on publically available information and do not interact with the target in a way that is detectable.
