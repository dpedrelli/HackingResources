# Port Scan
* ##### Decoys are useful to fill IDS logs with useless data.
* ##### DNS traffic may be allowed on the network and not filtered.  Setting source port to 53 may evade detection.
* ##### Add random data to header.
* ##### Spoof MAC address.
* ##### Randomize hosts (use both live hosts and non-live hosts).
