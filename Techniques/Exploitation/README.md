### NTLMv2
* Uses timestamp that changes response, every time.
* The key is a hash, negating dictionary attacks.
* Possible to brute-force the HMAC key.
* The NTLMv2 is bound to a particular server, meaning it is not reasuable.

### SMB Relay NTLMv1
Attacker sets up a MitM and specifies the Target as the SMBHOST in the Metasploit module.  When the other party in the MitM attempts to initiate an SMB connection, he will do so through the Attack machine.

### EternalBlue (MS17-010)
This can result in a blue screen of death, on the target computer.

# Client-side Exploits
These are exploits that run, locally, on the target, and usually require user action on the target (such as clicking a link).  These exploit may require social engineering.
##### [Exploit Adobe Flash with Metasploit](../../Tools/Metasploit/README.md#Exploit-Client-with-Adobe-Flash)
##### [Exploit Firefox with Metasploit](../../Tools/Metasploit/README.md#Exploit-Client-with-Firefox)

# Remote Exploits
These exploits do not require user interaction.  Typically, they target services running and listening on the target.
##### [Establish Shell with Responder](../../Tools/MitM/Responder/README.md#Establish-Shell)

# Local Privilege Escalation
This attack comes after an attacker has limited access to a target and wants to gain elevated privileges.
