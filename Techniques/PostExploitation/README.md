# Guidelines
* ##### Record Changes
  Record all changes made against compromised machines. Include those changes in the final report.
* ##### Sensitive Information
  Protect all information gathered, to the point of encrypting it, and deleting it when the penetration test is completed. Obfuscate or mask sensitive information, even in reports to the client.
* ##### Persistence
  Implement authentication with any persistence methods used, to prevents others from accessing the system.  
* ##### Clean-up
  Remove all changes, when the penetration test is done.
* ##### Permanent Changes
  If the engagement allows for any permanent changes, such as deleting logs, make back-ups before making changes.

# Privilege Escalation / Local Exploits
This attack comes after an attacker has limited access to a target and wants to gain elevated privileges.
Unlike Remote and Client Exploits, this attack requires access to the target.

### Types
* Vertical - escalates privileges to a higher level user.
* Horizontal - moves laterally, to a different user, without increasing privileges.

### Shell
* Stable
* Privileged
* Persistent
